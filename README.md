# Password Generator Starter Code

-   Link to the webpage is here! https://hoodgail.github.io/password-generator/

## Description

For this project, I had to develop a usable application that a worker could use to generate a random password based on the criteria they choose. I was finally assigned with building the JavaScript that will power the webpage, despite the fact that the interface is well-polished and stylized. This website ought to be able to present the visitor with five prompts in terms of functionality.

– Does the user want to incorporate numbers?
– the desired length of the user's password.
– Does the user want to use lowercase letters?

-   Whether the user wants to utilize capital letters.
    – Does the user want any unique characters to be included?
